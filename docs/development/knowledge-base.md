# Engineering Knowledge Base
*Central repository of lessons learned, API quirks, and architectural gotchas.*

## General
- [2024-03-20] **Workflow**: Always run `/verify` before PR to catch regression.
- [2026-01-22] **Workflow**: Implement a "Branch Guard" in verification scripts to prevent accidental commits to `main`. This is safer than relying solely on server-side protection during local development.
- [2026-01-20] **Architecture**: Engines (`ExecutionEngine`) create domain objects but Repositories (`PositionRepository`) must persist them. Ensure orchestration layer bridges this gap.
- [2026-01-20] **Testing**: When mocking execution logic, ensure `ENVIRONMENT` settings match expected behavior (e.g., `PROD` + `ENABLE_EXECUTION=False` -> triggers Theoretical fallback).
- [2026-01-20] **Testing**: `MagicMock(spec=PydanticModel)` does not automatically populate model fields as attributes. You must explicitly set them (e.g., `mock_pos.side = ...`) or use a helper, otherwise `AttributeError` occurs on access.
- [2026-01-20] **Testing**: When introducing new dependencies (e.g., `RiskEngine` inside `ExecutionEngine`), ensure existing unit tests patch the new dependency to avoid side effects (e.g., network calls or unexpected rejections) in legacy tests.
- [2026-01-20] **CI/CD**: Do NOT add `conftest.py` to mock GCP credentials if GitHub Secrets already has `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` and deploy.yml passes it to the environment. Trust existing infrastructure instead of adding redundant mocking layers that violate project conventions.
- [2026-01-20] **Code Organization**: Artifacts folder is for permanent project documentation; temporary documentation (summaries, PR drafts, debug files) belongs in `temp/` folder. This keeps the repo clean and separates working files from deliverables.
- [2026-01-31] **Documentation Consistency**: "Redundancy Debt" can be avoided by consolidating fragmented documentation (e.g., Catalog + Schema) into a single "Handbook". This ensures a single source of truth and reduces the risk of stale fragments. Prioritize code-first automation (Pydantic introspection) to ensure the "map" stays in sync with the "territory."
- [2026-01-31] **Architecture**: Use Mermaid ER diagrams in Markdown to visualize Hot-to-Cold storage lineage (Firestore to BigQuery). Diagrams are more resilient to minor field name changes than manual tables and provide better high-level clarity for system flows.
- [2026-01-31] **Workflow**: Root-level documentation indices (`docs/README.md`) should provide direct entry points to consolidated "Source of Truth" handbooks to prevent developers from relying on legacy or fragmented fragments.
- [2026-01-20] **Testing Conventions**: `conftest.py` is a pytest plugin file for global fixtures, not a test module. Follow naming convention: test files are `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`. Adding conftest for one-off credential mocks violates this and confuses IDEs/linters.
- [2026-01-25] **Simulation Safety**: Running production pipelines locally (e.g., `main.py` with `ENVIRONMENT=PROD`) carries side effects if state reconciliation is active. If the local environment (e.g., Paper) differs from the DB target (Prod), reconcilers may incorrectly flag live data as "Zombies" and destructively update the DB. Always use read-only diagnostic scripts for production checks.

## APIs & Integrations
### Alpaca
- [2024-XX-XX] **Orders**: Market orders during extended hours are rejected. Use Limit orders.
- [2026-01-20] **Typing**: Alpaca SDK v2 objects often need explicit casting (e.g., `cast(Order, response)`) to satisfy Mypy strict checks, especially when accessing `status` or `id` on union types.
- [2026-01-21] **Typing**: Account fields (e.g., `buying_power`) can be returned as strings, decimals, or floats depending on the API version and field. Always use defensive parsing (`float(val)` with try-except) when mapping to strict schemas.
- [2026-01-22] **SDK Limitations**: The `TradingClient` (v2) in `alpaca-py` lacks a `get_account_activities` method. Use the raw REST method `client.get("/account/activities", params=...)` instead.
- [2026-01-22] **Raw API**: When using `client.get`, `date` objects in parameters must be explicitly converted to string (ISO format). Response objects are raw dicts/lists and should be wrapped (e.g., `_ActivityWrapper`) to maintain object attribute compatibility with typed codebases.
- [2026-01-22] **CFEE Settlement**: Crypto fees are posted as asynchronous `CFEE` events at T+1 (end of day), not at transaction time. Real-time logging requires an 'Estimated Fee' model, followed by a T+1 'Patch Pipeline' to reconcile actuals.
- [2026-01-25] **404 Handling**: A `404 Not Found` from Alpaca's `get_open_position` does NOT imply the position was closed manually. It handles both "never existed" and "already closed". To confirm a manual exit, you must explicitly search `get_orders(status='filled', side=OPPOSITE)` for a closing trade. Relying on 404 alone leads to false positives ("Exit Gaps").
- [2026-01-27] **Typing**: When using `alpaca-py` request objects in conditional blocks (Crypto vs Equity), assign them to distinct variables (e.g., `crypto_req` vs `stock_req`) rather than reusing a generic `req` variable. This avoids Mypy union type confusion where it cannot infer the specific attributes available on `req` later in the block.
- [2026-01-27] **Typing**: Always use `alpaca.trading.enums` (e.g., `QueryOrderStatus.CLOSED`) instead of raw strings for API requests. Mypy strict mode often flags raw strings as incompatible with the expected Enum type.

### Firestore
- [2024-XX-XX] **Queries**: Composite queries require an index. Check logs for the creation link.
- [2026-01-20] **Aggregation**: `count()` queries with filters (e.g., `.where("status", "==", "OPEN")`) REQUIRE a Composite Index (e.g., `status` ASC + `asset_class` ASC). Missing index causes GRPC errors.
- [2026-01-21] **Cooldown Logic**: Queries for most recent status exits (e.g., TP1_HIT) with a limit of 1 MUST have a composite index on `symbol` (ASC), `status` (ASC), and `timestamp` (DESC) to allow 48-hour time window filtering.

### GCP
- [2024-XX-XX] **Cloud Run**: Cold starts can exceed 10s. JIT warmup is essential.
- [2026-01-21] **BigQuery**: `insert_rows_json` does NOT support automatic schema evolution. Columns must exist in the table definition.
- [2026-01-21] **Staging Tables**: When altering a Fact table, the Staging table MUST be dropped and recreated (`CREATE TABLE ... LIKE ...`) to match the new schema.
- [2026-01-21] **Secrets**: Never commit SQL scripts with hardcoded Project IDs. Use placeholders and injection.
- [2026-01-21] **Dependency Injection**: Initialize GCP-related clients (Firestore, BigQuery) in engine constructors via optional arguments. This allows unit tests to inject `MagicMock` and prevents `DefaultCredentialsError` in CI environments that lack project-level authentication.
- [2026-02-02] **BigQuery Partitioning**: If a table is created without partitioning, you cannot add it later via `ALTER TABLE`. You must delete and recreate the table (or `CREATE TABLE new AS SELECT * FROM old` with partitioning). This is a critical failure point for `StrategySyncPipeline` in Production.
- [2026-02-02] **SchemaGuardian**: Exception handling for table creation must be robust against Race Conditions (e.g., `409 Conflict`). Multiple replicas starting simultaneously may all try to create the same missing table. Use `try/except: success` for `Conflict` errors to prevent pipeline crashes.
- [2026-02-02] **IAM Roles**: For CI/CD (GitHub Actions), a Service Account needs `Artifact Registry Writer` (to push images) and `Service Account User` (to deploy as itself). For Runtime (Cloud Run), it needs `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` (startup env vars) and `Cloud Datastore User` (data). Missing `ActAs` or `Writer` roles are common deployment blockers.

### Pydantic & Data Pipelines
- [2026-01-21] **Constraint Paradox**: Strict Pydantic validators (e.g., `PositiveFloat`) are excellent for data integrity but can catch "conceptually valid" failures (like a negative stop loss due to weird volatility) and crash the pipeline.
- [2026-01-21] **Safe Hydration Pattern**: To persist these "invalid" objects for analysis without relaxing the schema, use a "Safe Hydration" strategy:
  1. Catch the validation error early.
  2. Populate the strict fields with a safe constant (e.g., `0.0001` for `PositiveFloat` or explicit `SAFE_CONSTANTS`).
  3. Store the *real* invalid values in a metadata field (e.g., `rejection_reason` string or `trace` dict).
  4. Flag the object status clearly (e.g., `REJECTED_BY_FILTER`).
- [2026-01-21] **Zombie Prevention**: When routing these hydrate objects to analytics pipelines, explicitly bypass simulation logic (like market data fetching) that assumes valid data, or implementation will fail downstream. Force `PnL = 0` to preserve statistical integrity.
- [2026-01-21] **Pipeline Robustness**: Always guard date-based dataframe filtering (`df[df.index >= dt]`) with an `.empty` check. Pandas comparisons against empty indexes can raise `TypeError` or `ValueError` in certain contexts, crashing the pipeline for illiquid assets.
- [2026-01-26] **Reserved Keywords**: Pydantic models with fields named `class` (a Python keyword) cannot be instantiated via constructor kwargs (e.g., `Asset(class="crypto")` raises SyntaxError). specific `model_validate` or `Field(alias="class")` is required, but `model_validate({"class": "..."})` is the safest runtime approach for external data.


## Implementation & Scripting
- [2026-01-22] **Scripting**: Distinguish between standalone **setup/verification scripts** (`scripts/` root) and **operational module scripts** (`src/crypto_signals/scripts/`). Module scripts enable `python -m` execution and cleaner project imports.
- [2026-01-22] **Bootstrapping**: If a module requires environment variables (e.g., `ENVIRONMENT=PROD`) to be set *before* importing project configuration (which reads env on load), use `os.environ.setdefault()` followed by `# noqa: E402` on imports. This suppresses linter errors for non-top-level imports where order of execution is critical for proper initialization.
- [2026-01-22] **BigQuery**: When bridging from a schema-less (Firestore) to rigid (BigQuery) system, any field added to the source must be manually propagated through the ETL pipeline models (Pydantic) and added to BQ via `ALTER TABLE`. Pydantic handles NoSQL defaults (None), but BigQuery execution will fail on "unknown field" if the SQL schema is not evolved first.
- [2026-01-22] **Diagnostic Output**: Always direct transient diagnostic outputs to a gitignored `temp/reports/` folder. Standardize workflow temporary files in `temp/` subfolders (issues/, plan/, pr/, etc.) to maintain workspace hygiene.
- [2026-01-27] **Firestore ETL**: When moving data from Firestore (NoSQL) to BigQuery (SQL), the Firestore document ID (`doc.id`) is NOT part of the document data payload (`doc.to_dict()`). You must explicitly map it (e.g., `data['doc_id'] = doc.id`) during the extract phase if you need to reference it later (e.g., for cleanup/deletion). Failure to do so results in implicit ID loss and failed deletion logic.
- [2026-01-27] **Shell Security**: Scripts accepting user input (like PR numbers) must validate input rigorously (e.g., `[[ "$1" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]`). Unvalidated inputs in `gh api` calls can lead to SSRF or path traversal if the input is used to construct file paths.
- [2026-01-27] **Poetry Installation**: Prefer the official installer (`install.python-poetry.org`) over `pip install poetry`. The official installer isolates Poetry's dependencies from the system/project environment, preventing version conflicts with libraries like `requests` or `urllib3`.

## Testing & CI/CD
- [2026-01-27] **Testing**: `contextlib.ExitStack` is required when patching more than ~20 objects in a single test. Python's `with (...)` statement has a limit on statically nested blocks, which causes `SyntaxError: too many statically nested blocks`. Use `stack.enter_context(patch(...))` to bypass this limit dynamically.
- [2026-01-27] **Config Validation**: Strict Pydantic validators (e.g., "Field cannot be empty") in `config.py` act globally. If a unit test wants to test "disabled execution" mode by setting a key to empty, the global validator will crash the test setup. Use `@model_validator` with conditional logic (e.g., `if self.ENABLE_EXECUTION: check_keys()`) instead of unconditional field validators.
- [2026-01-23] **Dependency Injection**: Use explicit dependency injection (e.g., `repository=MagicMock()`) in engine constructors rather than relying on `conftest.py` patches or redundant mocks. This ensures unit tests never attempt to initialize real Cloud clients (Firestore, BigQuery) which causes `DefaultCredentialsError` in CI.
- [2026-01-23] **Schema Parity**: For integration tests involving BigQuery, create test tables using `CREATE TABLE ... LIKE PROD_TABLE`. Manually maintaining `_test` table definitions leads to drift and "Column not found" errors when production schemas evolve.
- [2026-01-23] **Property Mocking**: When testing logic that relies on `self.property` calling an external service (e.g., `ExecutionEngine.account`), mock the *class property* (`ExecutionEngine.account`) or the underlying client method, depending on architectural depth. Mocking the property directly is cleaner for unit tests.
- [2026-01-24] **Micro-Cap Safeguards**: Mathematical formulas (like `low - 0.5 * ATR`) break for assets with prices < 0.00001. Always implement a mathematical floor (Layer 1) AND an execution quantity cap (Layer 2) to prevent negative values and position sizing explosions.
- [2026-01-25] **CI Credential Safety**: `SignalGenerator` (and other engines) default to real Cloud Clients (e.g., `SignalRepository`) if no dependency is injected. This causes `DefaultCredentialsError` in CI. **Always** inject `MagicMock` for repositories in unit tests to prevent accidental cloud connection attempts.
- [2026-01-26] **Refactoring & Coverage**: When extracting logic from a "God Class" (e.g., `SignalGenerator`) to a helper class (e.g., `SignalParameterFactory`), you **MUST** create a dedicated test suite for the new helper. relying on the original class's tests will likely result in a massive coverage drop (e.g., from 80% to 20%) because the new file is technically "untested" even if it's used.
- [2026-01-26] **Mocking Risks**: `MagicMock` objects cast to `float()` default to `1.0`. If a mock method name is typoed (e.g. `mock.get_val` instead of `mock.get_value`), the mock object itself is returned, coercing to `1.0` and causing silent numeric failures in tests.
- [2026-01-26] **MyPy Legacy Strategy**: For large codebases with deep legacy type errors, do not use `type: ignore` everywhere. Use `pyproject.toml` `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` with `ignore_errors = true` for specific modules. This unblocks CI immediately while strictly enforcing types on new code.
- [2026-01-26] **Pytest Debugging**: If `pytest` collects 0 tests or fails silently, check for `NameError` at the module level (e.g., missing `import pytest` when using `@pytest.mark.skip`). These import errors in test files can abort collection without a clear traceback unless `--collect-only` is used.
- [2026-01-26] **SDK Stability**: The `alpaca-py` SDK v2 may deprecate or internalize methods (like `_get` becoming `_request` or changing behaviors). When fixing "AttributeError: object has no attribute 'x'", verify the available methods using `dir(obj)` or source inspection to distinguish between a renamed internal method and a logic error.
- [2026-01-26] **Internal APIs**: Relying on internal methods (starting with `_`) is fragile. If a public alternative exists (like `get_account_activities`), prefer it. However, if the public method returns strictly typed objects that break legacy dictionary-based logic, it may be safer to use the lower-level `_request` with explicit type verification (`isinstance(x, dict)`) as a robust workaround rather than refactoring the entire domain model improperly.
- [2026-01-27] **Testing**: `polyfactory` builds actual Pydantic models, not `MagicMock` objects. Dynamic attribute assignment (e.g., `signal._trail_updated = True`) will fail with `AttributeError` unless the model configuration allows extra fields. If a test relies on arbitrary attributes, manually patch the instance or use a mock instead.
- [2026-02-02] **Coverage Configuration**: If `pyproject.toml` sets a global `--cov-fail-under=80`, running `pytest` on a single file with low coverage will cause the entire command to fail (exit code 1), even if the tests pass. Use `pytest -c /dev/null` or override arguments to bypass global thresholds for ad-hoc checking.
- [2026-02-02] **Test Data Consistency**: When writing tests that assert against mocked queries, ensure that the data identifiers (e.g. `dataset.table`) in the mock setup match the actual code EXACTLY. A mismatch like `crypto_signals` vs `crypto_analytics` will cause confusing assertions like `[] != [SQL]`.

### Type Hints & Recursion
- [2026-01-27] **Pydantic & Recursion**: When mapping nested Pydantic models to external schemas (e.g., BigQuery `RECORD`s), use explicit recursion. `issubclass(type, BaseModel)` works well for Pydantic V2, but be wary if V1 compatibility layers are introduced as they might not inherit cleanly.
- [2026-01-27] **Type Unwrapping**: Python's `typing.get_origin` and `get_args` are essential for unwrapping `Optional[T]`, `List[T]`, and `Union[T, None]`. However, complex Unions (e.g., `Union[int, float]`) require specific handling logic and generally default to a lowest-common-denominator strategy (e.g., string) if not explicitly mapped.
- [2026-01-29] **Type Hint Consistency**: When refactoring a function to return structured data (e.g., `List[str]` → `List[tuple[str, str]]`), update ALL return type annotations in the call chain. Forgetting helper methods causes mypy/pyright false errors and confuses code reviewers.

### Exception Handling & CI/CD
- [2026-01-29] **Silent Failures**: Never swallow exceptions in CLI tools without re-raising. `except Exception as e: logger.error(...)` without `raise` causes the script to exit with code 0, falsely reporting success in CI/CD pipelines.
- [2026-01-29] **Redundant Exception Handling**: `except (SpecificError, Exception)` is redundant since `Exception` catches everything. Either catch only the specific error for targeted handling, or just catch `Exception`. Mixing them adds no value and signals code smell to reviewers.

### BigQuery Schema Evolution
- [2026-01-29] **ALTER TABLE Multi-Column**: BigQuery supports adding multiple columns in a single `ALTER TABLE` statement with comma-separated `ADD COLUMN` clauses. This is more efficient than individual ALTER statements and ensures atomicity within BigQuery's eventual consistency.
- [2026-01-29] **Migration CLI Pattern**: For controlled schema evolution, create a CLI tool that: (1) validates schema drift with `strict_mode=False`, (2) generates DDL programmatically, (3) executes with proper error propagation. This avoids manual SQL and integrates with existing validation frameworks.

### Code Review Best Practices
- [2026-01-29] **Jules Delegation Review**: When reviewing work delegated to AI assistants (like Jules), focus on: (1) type safety / annotation consistency, (2) exception handling completeness, (3) test coverage for error paths. AI-generated code often handles happy paths well but may miss edge case handling and CI/CD implications.

### Broker API Constraints
- [2026-01-29] **Alpaca Notional Minimum**: Alpaca rejects orders with notional value below $1 (crypto) or $10 (equity). Use a safety buffer (e.g., $15) and validate BEFORE submitting to avoid API errors. Log the calculated notional value for debugging.
- [2026-01-29] **DRY Validation Pattern**: When the same validation logic applies across multiple execution paths (e.g., crypto vs equity), extract to a helper method immediately. Duplicated validation logic drifts over time and leads to inconsistent behavior.
- [2026-01-29] **Helper Method Naming**: For boolean validation helpers, use `_is_*_sufficient()` or `_has_*()` naming convention. This makes the condition readable in if-statements: `if not self._is_notional_value_sufficient(qty, signal)`.

### Discord API
- [2026-01-29] **Forum Channel Thread Requirement**: Discord Forum Channels (type 15) require `thread_name` in webhook payloads. Omitting it causes `400 Bad Request`. Add a config flag (e.g., `DISCORD_USE_FORUMS`) to conditionally include `thread_name`.
- [2026-01-29] **Module-Level Constants**: For sets used in multiple methods (e.g., `BULLISH_PATTERNS`), define as module-level `frozenset` to avoid duplication and enable O(1) lookups. This also makes the constant visible for import/testing.
- [2026-01-29] **Text Channel Fallback**: When posting to Discord with `thread_name` but the webhook targets a Text Channel (not Forum), Discord returns `400`. Implement retry logic that strips `thread_name` and retries for graceful degradation.

### Architecture & Patterns
- [2026-01-29] **Repository Pattern**: Always encapsulate Firestore access (e.g., `dim_strategies`) in a dedicated Repository class rather than using raw clients in pipelines. This ensures consistent error handling, centralized query logic, and significantly easier mocking in unit tests.
- [2026-01-29] **Merge Strategy**: When merging multiple concurrent feature branches (e.g., Metrics Fixes, Strategy Sync, Snapshot), carefully inspect central orchestration files like `main.py`. Automated merges often drop lines or duplicate logic blocks. Verify the presence of ALL features post-merge before running tests.

### Testing
- [2026-01-29] **Pydantic Mocking**: When unit testing logic that relies on Pydantic's `model_dump()`, mocking the model instance with `MagicMock` often fails because `model_dump` is a complex method. Use real Pydantic model instances in tests whenever possible to avoid "mock drift" where tests pass but runtime fails.
- [2026-01-29] **ExitStack Pattern**: When a test requires patching many dependencies (e.g., > 10) to isolate a "God Function" like `main()`, use `contextlib.ExitStack`. Standard nested `with patch():` blocks hit Python's stack limit (`SyntaxError: too many statically nested blocks`).
- [2026-01-29] **Pytest Config Override**: If `pyproject.toml` enforces strict plugins (like `pytest-cov`) that are failing in a specific environment, use `pytest -o "addopts=" ...` to override the configuration at runtime and isolate the test logic from the tooling environment.

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- [2026-01-30] **Container Permissions**: `joblib.Memory` creates a cache directory upon initialization. In restricted container environments (like Cloud Run), the application user often cannot write to the default location. Solved by initializing conditionally: `memory = joblib.Memory(location=None)` when caching is disabled. This prevents directory creation attempts during module import.
- [2026-01-30] **Bash Scripting**: When generating visual separators, `printf '%.0s=' {1..80}` is more portable and reliable than `echo "=" * 80` (which zsh handles but bash sometimes treats literally or requires loops).
- **Pydantic Defaults**: For conditional defaults based on other fields (e.g. `ENVIRONMENT`), use `default=None` and a `@model_validator` to set the value. Avoiding `default_factory` for simple env-based logic keeps the schema cleaner and validation more predictable.
- [2026-01-30] **Linting in Tests**: Test files (`tests/`) must adhere to the same linting standards as source code (including import sorting `I001`). `ruff check --fix` is essential before committing.
- [2026-01-30] **Pre-Commit Hooks**: If pre-commit hooks modify files (e.g., formatting), the commit fails. You must re-stage the modified files (`git add`) and commit again. `pre-commit run --all-files` is a good manual check before pushing.
- [2026-01-30] **Docker Env Files**: Docker's `--env-file` parser reads values literally and does NOT strip inline comments. A line like `VAR=val # comment` results in the value `"val # comment"`, causing Pydantic validation errors. Comments must be on their own lines.
- [2026-01-30] **CI/CD Validation**: When running container validation checks (e.g., `python -c "import main"`) in GitHub Actions, you must explicitly inject required environment variables (like `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`) if the module initialization relies on strict Pydantic settings. Using `vars.GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` context is preferred.
- [2026-01-30] **Windows WSL**: On Windows, invoking `bash` from PowerShell may target a broken WSL distribution instead of Git Bash. Use the absolute path to the Git Bash executable (e.g., `& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"`) for reliable script execution.

### BigQuery & Data Engineering
- [2026-01-30] **SQL Division**: BigQuery Standard SQL defaults to `FLOAT64` division (`/`). `SAFE_DIVIDE(x, y)` is useful for zero-safety but technically redundant in `GROUP BY` counts (guaranteed >= 1). However, defensive programming often prefers explicit safety.
- [2026-01-30] **Schema Management**: Avoid hardcoding BigQuery schemas in pipelines. Use `SchemaGuardian` (or similar utility) to dynamically generate schemas from Pydantic models. This ensures single source of truth and eliminates drift.

### Workflow & Git
- [2026-01-30] **Reverting Feedback**: When rejecting PR feedback that was partially applied, ensure specific commits are reverted cleanly. `git reset` or `git revert` is safer than manual edits which might miss artifacts (like stale comments).
- [2026-01-30] **Pre-Commit Formatting**: Tools like `ruff-format` modify files in place, causing git commits to fail. The remediation is to simply `git add` the modified files and retry the commit.
- [2026-01-30] **Testing (SQL)**: Testing generated SQL strings is inherently fragile due to whitespace/formatting differences. Avoid exact string matching (`assert query == expected`). Instead, use semantically aware comparison tools like `sqlglot` (e.g. `transpile(query) == transpile(expected)`) or verify the presence of key components/clauses.
- [2026-01-30] **BigQuery (Merge)**: When generating `MERGE` statements dynamically from Pydantic models, the column order in the `INSERT (...)` clause MUST match the `VALUES (...)` clause. Dictionary iteration order is not guaranteed to be consistent or match schema definition order unless explicitly sorted. Always sort keys (e.g. `sorted(model.fields.keys())`) before SQL generation.
- [2026-01-30] **Git Recovery**: If a remote feature branch is deleted but local work exists, `git reset --hard` to the target integration branch followed by `git merge <local_branch>` is a clean recovery pattern. This avoids complex rebase conflicts that arise from divergent histories.
- [2026-01-30] **MyPy (Pydantic)**: Ensure `check_untyped_defs = true` is enabled in mypy configuration. Without it, Pydantic models (which make heavy use of dynamic typing/plugins) may silently allow `Any` types, masking valid type errors in field validators or method signatures.
- [2026-02-01] **Reconciliation Patterns**: "Absence of Evidence is not Evidence of Absence." When reconciling state between a DB and an API, a missing record in the API (e.g., `get_position` -> 404) is insufficient proof to execute a destructive helper in the DB (like closing a position). You must verify the *positive* action (e.g., finding the specific Sell Order) before altering state.
- [2026-02-01] **Race Conditions**: APIs often have "Eventual Consistency" windows. When a resource is created, it might not be listed in `get_all` queries for a few seconds/minutes. Systems relying on "Sync Loops" must implement a "Grace Period" (ignore items created < X min ago) to prevent falsely flagging valid new resources as desynchronized "Zombies."
- [2026-02-01] **Defensive Coding**: Dead code isn't always trash. Methods like `handle_manual_exit_verification` may be critical safety gates that were implemented but never wired up. Before deleting "unused" methods in domain logic, verify if they were intended as safety latches for edge cases that haven't occurred yet.
- [2026-02-01] **BigQuery Safety**: Schema evolution in production should be "Additive Only". New columns must be `NULLABLE` (even if required in code) to prevent breaking existing rows or ingestion pipelines.
- [2026-02-01] **Documentation Pipelines**: To prevent "Schema Drift" (docs vs code), documentation generation must be integrated into the CI pipeline (`deploy.yml`) and local verification workflows (`verify`, `pr`). Relying on manual updates guarantees obsolescence.
- [2026-02-01] **Operational Config**: Critical toggles (like Schema Migration behavior) should be exposed via environment variables (`deploy.yml`) rather than hardcoded. This allows operators to flip safety switches (e.g., enable strict mode) without code changes/redeploys.
- [2026-02-01] **Github Workflows**: When using `gh pr create` in automation, the PR body template must use explicit closing keywords (e.g. `Fixes #123`) for auto-closure to work. Merely linking (`#123`) is insufficient.
- [2026-02-01] **CI Troubleshooting**: GitHub Actions `poetry run` commands usually require `PYTHONPATH=src` explicitly set (e.g., `PYTHONPATH=src poetry run sync-docs`) if the script imports module code, as the container environment may not automatically resolve the source root for entry points.
- [2026-02-02] **Cloud Run & Git**: Docker containers (like `python:slim`) often lack system binaries like `git`. Relying on them for runtime logic (e.g. version stamping) crashes the app. Always implement dual-layer fallback: try `subprocess` first, then fall back to environment variables (`GIT_SHA`).
- [2026-02-02] **Testing System Calls**: To verify resilience against missing binaries, mocks must simulate the exact OS error (`FileNotFoundError`) rather than a generic `Exception`. Generic mocks can mask "path not found" vs "permission denied" distinctions.
- [2026-02-02] **Assertion Usability**: In complex diagnostic suites, "Bare Assertions" (`assert x == y`) are anti-patterns because CI logs only show "False". Use "Rich Assertions" (custom helpers that diff dictionaries or lists) to print human-readable failure reasons (e.g. "Missing key 'status' in payload").
- [2026-02-02] **Defensive Defaults**: Public API methods should never crash on `None` inputs if a reasonable default exists. For example, `lookback_days` in market data providers should default to a safe window (e.g. 365) rather than propagating `NoneType` errors to the engine.
- [2026-02-02] **Schema Robustness**: For non-critical fields (like `strategy_id` in execution reports), data ingestion often fails on "Missing" values. Use Pydantic pre-validators to coerce `None` or missing keys to explicit "UNKNOWN" sentinels. This preserves the valuable record (the trade) even if metadata is imperfect.
- [2026-02-02] **Book Balancing**: Relying solely on "Open Position" sync is insufficient for state reconciliation. A "Reverse Orphan" (Position Open in Broker, Closed/Missing in DB) can be invisible to standard checks if the DB query is the driver. You made a dedicated `book_balancing.py` tool to cross-reference Broker History (Fills/Closed Orders) against DB state to catch these "dark matter" positions.
- [2026-02-02] **Pyramiding Protection**: Logic that relies on `MAX_POSITIONS` limits is insufficient to prevent double-buying the *same* asset. You must implement a dedicated `check_duplicate_symbol(signal)` gate in the Risk Engine to prevent "Stacking" positions (e.g., buying AAVE twice because the first buy didn't register as "Closed" yet).
- [2026-02-02] **Zombie Persistence**: When a Reconciler finds a "Zombie" (Open in DB, Missing in Broker), simply marking it closed is dangerous without verification. However, failing to close it leaves the system in a "Critical Error" loop. The pattern: Attempt to verify exit via Order History. If verification fails (no matching exit order found), **alert the human** but do NOT auto-close. Manual intervention > Data loss.
- [2026-02-02] **CLI Testing**: Use Dependency Injection for `rich.console.Console` in CLI tools. Avoid `unittest.mock.patch` on module-level `console` objects, as it leads to `MagicMock` type confusion and breaks assertions. Inject `console_client` in `__init__`.
- [2026-02-05] **Pydantic Model Defaults**: When using Pydantic models with `extra="allow"` for flexible configs (like `ConfluenceConfig`), remember that `model_dump()` includes ALL default values alongside extra fields. Tests asserting against serialized output must expect the full model dump, not just the input values.
- [2026-02-05] **Type Annotations for Collections**: Python 3.9+ supports `set[str]` directly, but for broader compatibility consider `Set[str]` from `typing`. When changing collection types (e.g., `Dict` to `set`), ensure all methods used (`.add()` vs `[key]=`) are compatible.
- [2026-02-05] **Discord Forum Mode**: When `DISCORD_USE_FORUMS` is enabled, thread_name is required. If development webhooks target Forum channels but `TEST_MODE` doesn't auto-generate thread names, you'll get 400 errors. Solution: proactively generate thread names when either `DISCORD_USE_FORUMS=True` OR `TEST_MODE=True`.
- [2026-02-05] **BigQuery NotFound Logging**: `SchemaGuardian.validate_schema` should catch `NotFound` exceptions separately from `GoogleAPICallError` and re-raise without logging ERROR. Non-existent tables are expected during first run and should not pollute error logs.
- [2026-02-05] **Alpaca SDK Versioning**: The `alpaca-py` SDK may change method names between versions. `._request()` may become `.get()` or vice versa. When fixing "AttributeError", verify available methods with `dir(client)` and prefer public APIs over private methods when possible.
- [2026-02-05] **Refactoring & Testing**: When moving modules (e.g., `scripts/foo.py` -> `scripts/bar/foo.py`), `unittest.mock.patch` paths in tests must be updated manually. IDE refactoring often misses string-based patch targets, leading to `AttributeError` or `ImportError` runtime failures. grep is your friend.
- [2026-02-05] **Pytest Cache**: Significant refactoring (file moves/renames) can leave stale bytecode in `__pycache__`, causing pytest to load "ghost" modules. Always run `find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +` (or equivalent) after structural changes if strange import errors persist.
- [2026-02-05] **Maintenance Scripts**: Dangerous maintenance scripts (like `purge_signals.py`) should be consistently gated by `ENVIRONMENT != "PROD"` checks AND explicit user confirmation prompts (`Confirm.ask`) to prevent accidental data loss in production.

- [2026-02-11] **BigQuery Schema**: Adding REQUIRED columns to existing tables is forbidden; must use NULLABLE. migrate_schema must check not just for missing columns but for type compatibility of existing columns to prevent data corruption.
- [2026-02-11] **MyPy/Alpaca**: When iterating over lists of complex objects (like `alpaca.trading.models.Position`), extensive use of `typing.cast()` or intermediate variables with explicit type hints is often necessary to resolve Union attribute errors.
- [2026-02-11] **Alpaca-py Type Hints**: `get_all_positions()` has a return type of `List[Union[Position, RawData]]` which confuses strict type checkers. Explicitly typing variables as `List[Position]` does not narrow the type. The verified workaround is to use `# type: ignore` on valid usages where runtime behavior is known to be correct.

### Execution & Risk
- [2026-02-10] **Impedance Mismatch**: Alpaca uses an *aggregate* position model (one per symbol), while Firestore uses a *discrete* model (one per signal). This requires strict application-level guards (validating `signal_id` on close) to prevent "phantom sells" where an old signal's exit logic inadvertently closes a newly opened position for the same symbol.
- [2026-02-10] **API Exception Patterns**: `alpaca.get_open_position(symbol)` raises an exception (404) if no position exists, instead of returning `None`. Code must wrap this in `try-except` to interpret "Not Found" correctly as "Zero Quantity" rather than a system error.
- [2026-02-10] **Fail-Open Strategy**: For high-frequency pre-execution guards (like "Check Duplicate Symbol"), a "Fail-Open" pattern (log exception but proceed) is often safer than "Fail-Closed". It prevents transient API flakiness (e.g. rate limits) from paralyzing the entire trading engine, accepting a marginal risk of duplication during outages.
- [2026-02-10] **SDK Exceptions**: `alpaca-py`'s `APIError` embeds the status code in the underlying `http_error.response`. Mocks must replicate this structure (`mock_http_error.response.status_code = 404`) rather than setting `.status_code` on the exception instance directly, which is read-only.
- [2026-02-10] **Critical Error Handling**: Never use bare `except Exception` in financial logic. It masks `AttributeError` (bugs) and conflates transient failures (500) with state confirmations (404). Always check specific error codes before performing destructive actions (like closing positions).
- [2026-02-11] **Risk Analysis**: Risk checks must return structured results (`passed`, `reason`, `gate_id`) instead of boolean flags. This allows downstream analytics to differentiate between specific failure modes (e.g., "Capital Exhausted" vs "Sector Cap Hit").
- [2026-02-11] **Concurrency Testing**: When fixing race conditions (e.g., TP/Entry synchronization), verify the resolution with a dedicated stress test (`test_tp_automation_race.py`) that simulates parallel execution. Standard unit tests often miss timing-dependent failures.
- [2026-02-12] **Structured Logging**: Always use the `extra` dictionary for variable data in logs (e.g., `logger.error("Msg", extra={"id": ...})`). Embedding variables directly in f-strings (`f"Msg {id}"`) causes `KeyError` in log formatting middleware if the string contains braces, and makes searching by field impossible in Cloud Logging.
- [2026-02-12] **Pydantic Testing**: When asserting against `model_dump()`, use `model_dump(mode='python')` to get native types (like `Decimal`) instead of JSON primitives. Also, remember that `model_dump()` includes all default values, so your expected dict must be complete.

### Pydantic & Typing
- [2026-02-13] **Pydantic V2 & Mocks**: `arbitrary_types_allowed=True` does NOT bypass validation for fields typed as `BaseModel` subclasses. Pydantic v2 attempts to validate the schema of the subclass even if a Mock is passed. To support `MagicMock` in tests for these fields, use `typing.Any` with a type comment (e.g., `signal: Any  # type: Signal`) instead of the strict type hint.

### Observability & Metrics
- [2026-02-13] **Metric Timing**: Do not reuse timer variables (like `start_time`) across multi-phase pipelines. Latency metrics must measure *exclusive* phase duration. Always initialize a fresh `processing_start = time.time()` at the beginning of the phase block to avoid polluting metrics with upstream latency.

### Linting & Quality
- [2026-02-13] **Unused Variables**: Ruff rule `B007` flags unused loop control variables. If a variable from an unpacked tuple is not needed, prefix it with an underscore (e.g., `for sig, _, _ in items:`) to explicitly indicate intent and silence the linter.

### Test Suite Hygiene
- [2026-02-13] **Pytest Collection Warnings**: Classes named `Test*` (e.g., `TestModel`, `TestPipeline`) in test files are collected by pytest as test classes, triggering `PytestCollectionWarning` when they lack test methods. Rename helper/fixture classes to `Mock*` or `Stub*` to avoid collision with pytest's default `python_classes = Test*` collection pattern.
- [2026-02-13] **Mock Spec for Alpaca Models**: Using `MagicMock()` without `spec=` for Alpaca SDK models (e.g., `Position`, `Order`) causes XFAIL-worthy failures when production code accesses specific model attributes or uses `isinstance` checks. Always use `MagicMock(spec=ModelClass)` and explicitly set required attributes to match the SDK's attribute contract.
- [2026-02-13] **Performance Test Thresholds**: Numba JIT-compiled functions achieve 2-5ms locally but can take 50-200ms in CI due to shared runners, cold caches, and CPU throttling. Set thresholds at 4× the expected CI worst case (e.g., 200ms for a 50ms-expected operation) rather than 20× (1s), which masks genuine algorithmic regressions.

### Alpaca API & Pagination
- [2026-02-14] **Pagination Logic**: The Alpaca `get_account_activities` endpoint (and raw `/account/activities`) does *not* auto-paginate. You must manually implement a loop using the `page_token` parameter (set to the `id` of the last item in the previous batch).
- [2026-02-14] **Loop Safety**: When implementing manual pagination loops, always include a definitive break condition based on batch size (e.g., `if len(batch) < page_size: break`). This prevents infinite loops if the API returns a full page of duplicate/stuck data or if mocking logic is imperfect.
- [2026-02-14] **Mocking Pagination**: Mocks for paginated endpoints must return data that satisfies the loop's termination logic (e.g., unique `id`s for token generation). Returning valid-looking but static data (same ID) can cause infinite loops in tests.

### Debugging & Environment
- [2026-02-14] **Pytest Source Resolution**: In Poetry environments, `pytest` may inadvertently test the *installed* package in `.venv` rather than the local `src/` code. If changes aren't reflecting, print `module.__file__` or raise an intentional exception to confirm the execution path.
- [2026-02-14] **Error Swallowing**: Broad `try/except` blocks inside loops can hide critical logic errors (like `UnboundLocalError` due to missing variable initialization). During development, log exceptions with full tracebacks or re-raise them to surface hidden bugs early.

### Testing & Quality
- [2026-02-16] **Mock Completeness**: When a method under test accesses an attribute (like `position.created_at`), the mock object MUST explicitly define it. `MagicMock(spec=Model)` does verify access against the spec, but it does NOT populate optional fields with defaults. Missing attributes cause `AttributeError` in tests even if the field is optional in the Pydantic model.
- [2026-02-16] **Fuzzy Assertions**: Avoid exact string matching for error messages (`assert msg == "Error X"`). Error strings change frequently (punctuation, detailed context). Use substring matching (`assert "Error X" in msg`) or `any()` for list checks (`any("Error X" in i for i in issues)`) to reduce test brittleness.

### Reconciliation & State
- [2026-02-16] **Grace Periods**: In distributed systems (Broker vs DB), "Instant" consistency is a myth. Reconcilers must implement a "Grace Period" (e.g. `created_at < now - 5min`) before declaring a "Zombie" (exists in DB, missing in Broker) to avoid race conditions where the Broker API lags behind the DB write.
- [2026-02-16] **Schema Alignment**: Renaming fields in Pydantic models (e.g., `execution_time` -> `duration_seconds`) requires a comprehensive grep of the codebase. IDE refactoring tools often miss usage in `kwargs` unpacking or dictionary construction. Always verify instantiation sites manually.
