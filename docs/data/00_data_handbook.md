# Data Handbook & Schema Glossary V3.0

This document is the **Definitive Source of Truth** for all data structures in the system. It bridges the gap between the Python domain logic (`schemas.py`), operational storage (Firestore), and analytical storage (BigQuery).

---

## 1. Data Modeling Strategy

We utilize a **Star Schema** variant optimized for BigQuery (Columnar Storage) while maintaining document-oriented consistency in Firestore.

### Dimensional Patterns
1.  **SCD Type 2 (Slowly Changing Dimensions)**: Applied to `dim_strategies`. Configuration changes trigger new versions to preserve historical performance integrity.
2.  **Degenerate Dimensions**: High-cardinality IDs like `signal_id` and `alpaca_order_id` are stored directly in Fact tables.
3.  **Snapshot Grain**: Point-in-time state captured daily for account health (`snapshot_accounts`).

---

## 2. Shared Vocabulary (Enums)

All models share a common set of enums defined in `src/crypto_signals/domain/schemas.py`:
- **AssetClass**: `CRYPTO`, `EQUITY`
- **SignalStatus**: `WAITING`, `INVALIDATED`, `EXPIRED`, `TP1_HIT`, etc.
- **OrderSide**: `buy`, `sell`
- **ExitReason**: `TP1`, `STOP_LOSS`, `COLOR_FLIP`, `MANUAL_EXIT`, etc.

## 3. Storage Layers & Entities

### A. Operational Storage (Firestore - "Hot")
Optimized for write speed and real-time lifecycle management.

| Entity | Collection | Description | Key Fields |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategy** | `dim_strategies` | The "Brain". Defines rules and risk. | `strategy_id`, `active`, `assets`, `risk_params` |
| **Signal** | `live_signals` | Potential opportunities. | `signal_id`, `status`, `valid_until`, `side` |
| **Position** | `live_positions`| Active trades in the broker. | `position_id`, `entry_fill_price`, `current_stop_loss` |

### B. Analytical Warehouse (BigQuery - "Cold")
Optimized for aggregation, backtesting, and performance reporting.

| Entity | Table | Description | Partition Key |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trade Fact** | `fact_trades` | Immutable ledger of closed trades. | `ds` (Execution Date) |
| **Account Snapshot** | `snapshot_accounts` | Daily account health metrics. | `ds` (Snapshot Date) |
| **Rejected Signal** | `fact_rejected_signals`| Shadow tracking for quality gates. | `ds` (Generation Date) |
